Description: Perl module for finding user directories across platforms
 File::HomeDir is a module for locating the directories that are "owned" by a
 user (typically your user) and to solve the various issues that arise trying
 to find them consistently across a wide variety of platforms.
 .
 The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any platform,
 making it relatively trivial to create Perl software that works elegantly and
 correctly no matter where you run it.
